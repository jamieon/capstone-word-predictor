# capstone-word-predictor
Word prediction shiny app
This Data Science Capstone project is a Johns Hopkins Uni course at Coursera. The project deals with natural language processing starting from raw data to be cleaned and ending with a prediction algorithm to predict next word after a user inputs some text. The prediction model is built into a constructed Shiny application and the source code is found here. For short presentation see: https://rpubs.com/jamieon/capstone-word-predictor and the application itself: https://jamieon.shinyapps.io/word-predictor/
